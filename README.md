# S-GS9_-_9-_U.S._Sapdragon_Exploitation
Exploitation to gain kernel level access of the Samsung Galaxy S9 &amp; S9+  (we will find the crack and when we do it's a game changer. Lets make Samsung and Root Universals. They go hand in hand. Seriously only lock down the U.S. North American variants. Well we love touchwiz but we also love root. For example titanium backup, magisk modules to improve upon older hardware. And the number reason is a tie, *I'm an audiophile* I absolutely have to have V4Android....... and developing and modifying either stock rom's, development builds, just want people to have what they paid for but at the same time these phones are extremly highend personal computers. If i want to change something give me the oem unlock option! Working on a boot loader unlock method that seems extremely promising. I'll post unimportant aspects at various development stages.  And get my team all working our magic.
